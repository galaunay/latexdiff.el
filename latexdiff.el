;;; Commentary:

;; Latexdiff.el is a backend for
;; [Latexdiff](https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff).

;; latexdiff requires Emacs-24.4 or later
;; and optionnaly [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm).

;; Configuration:

;; latexdiff faces and behaviour can be customized through the customization
;; panel :
;; `(customize-group 'latexdiff)`
;; Latexdiff.el does not define default keybindings, so you may want to add
;; some using `define-key`.

;; Basic usage

;; File to file diff:
;; - `latexdiff` will ask for two tex files and generates a tex diff between
;;   them (that you will need to compile).
;; Version diff (git repo only):
;; - `latexdiff-vc` (and `helm-latexdiff-vc`) will ask for a previous commit
;;   number and make a pdf diff between this version and the current one.
;; - `latexdiff-vc-range` (and `helm-latexdiff-vc-range`) will ask for two
;;   commits number and make a pdf diff between those two versions.
